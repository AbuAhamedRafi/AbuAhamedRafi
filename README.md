## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

I'm a software developer driven by curiosity and a passion for solving real-world problems through technology. With a strong foundation in full-stack development and a growing interest in open source, I enjoy building systems that are both functional and meaningful.

- I learn by doing. Breaking things, fixing them, and sometimes rewriting them better is my approach  
- I care about writing code that not only works but makes sense to the next person reading it (even if it's future me)  
- I am the kind of developer who bookmarks changelogs, experiments with new stacks on weekends, and contributes where I can.
